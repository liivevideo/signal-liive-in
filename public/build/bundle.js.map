It analyzes\n * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n *\n * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n *\n * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should\n * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n *\n * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n *\n * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n *\n *   getInitialState: function() {\n *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n *   }\n *\n * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node whose\n *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n *\n *   // In render function:\n *   return (\n *     <View\n *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n *       <View>\n *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n *       </View>\n *     </View>\n *   );\n *\n * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n *\n * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n *   that you should implement.\n *\n *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\n *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n *   },\n *\n * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() {\n *     return 20;\n *   }\n *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory).\n *   touchableGetPressRectOffset: function() {\n *     return {top: 20, left: 20, right: 20, bottom: 100};\n *   }\n */\n\n/**\n * Touchable states.\n */\nvar States=keyMirror({\nNOT_RESPONDER:null,// Not the responder\nRESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_IN:null,// Responder, inactive, in the `PressRect`\nRESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_OUT:null,// Responder, inactive, out of `PressRect`\nRESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_IN:null,// Responder, active, in the `PressRect`\nRESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_OUT:null,// Responder, active, out of `PressRect`\nRESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_IN:null,// Responder, active, in the `PressRect`, after long press threshold\nRESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_OUT:null,// Responder, active, out of `PressRect`, after long press threshold\nERROR:null});\n\n\n/**\n * Quick lookup map for states that are considered to be \"active\"\n */\nvar IsActive={\nRESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_OUT:true,\nRESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_IN:true};\n\n\n/**\n * Quick lookup for states that are considered to be \"pressing\" and are\n * therefore eligible to result in a \"selection\" if the press stops.\n */\nvar IsPressingIn={\nRESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_IN:true,\nRESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_IN:true,\nRESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_IN:true};\n\n\nvar IsLongPressingIn={\nRESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_IN:true};\n\n\n/**\n * Inputs to the state machine.\n */\nvar Signals=keyMirror({\nDELAY:null,\nRESPONDER_GRANT:null,\nRESPONDER_RELEASE:null,\nRESPONDER_TERMINATED:null,\nENTER_PRESS_RECT:null,\nLEAVE_PRESS_RECT:null,\nLONG_PRESS_DETECTED:null});\n\n\n/**\n * Mapping from States x Signals => States\n */\nvar Transitions={\nNOT_RESPONDER:{\nDELAY:States.ERROR,\nRESPONDER_GRANT:States.RESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_IN,\nRESPONDER_RELEASE:States.ERROR,\nRESPONDER_TERMINATED:States.ERROR,\nENTER_PRESS_RECT:States.ERROR,\nLEAVE_PRESS_RECT:States.ERROR,\nLONG_PRESS_DETECTED:States.ERROR},\n\nRESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_IN:{\nDELAY:States.RESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_IN,\nRESPONDER_GRANT:States.ERROR,\nRESPONDER_RELEASE:States.NOT_RESPONDER,\nRESPONDER_TERMINATED:States.NOT_RESPONDER,\nENTER_PRESS_RECT:States.RESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_IN,\nLEAVE_PRESS_RECT:States.RESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_OUT,\nLONG_PRESS_DETECTED:States.ERROR},\n\nRESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_OUT:{\nDELAY:States.RESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_OUT,\nRESPONDER_GRANT:States.ERROR,\nRESPONDER_RELEASE:States.NOT_RESPONDER,\nRESPONDER_TERMINATED:States.NOT_RESPONDER,\nENTER_PRESS_RECT:States.RESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_IN,\nLEAVE_PRESS_RECT:States.RESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_OUT,\nLONG_PRESS_DETECTED:States.ERROR},\n\nRESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_IN:{\nDELAY:States.ERROR,\nRESPONDER_GRANT:States.ERROR,\nRESPONDER_RELEASE:States.NOT_RESPONDER,\nRESPONDER_TERMINATED:States.NOT_RESPONDER,\nENTER_PRESS_RECT:States.RESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_IN,\nLEAVE_PRESS_RECT:States.RESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_OUT,\nLONG_PRESS_DETECTED:States.RESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_IN},\n\nRESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_OUT:{\nDELAY:States.ERROR,\nRESPONDER_GRANT:States.ERROR,\nRESPONDER_RELEASE:States.NOT_RESPONDER,\nRESPONDER_TERMINATED:States.NOT_RESPONDER,\nENTER_PRESS_RECT:States.RESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_IN,\nLEAVE_PRESS_RECT:States.RESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_OUT,\nLONG_PRESS_DETECTED:States.ERROR},\n\nRESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_IN:{\nDELAY:States.ERROR,\nRESPONDER_GRANT:States.ERROR,\nRESPONDER_RELEASE:States.NOT_RESPONDER,\nRESPONDER_TERMINATED:States.NOT_RESPONDER,\nENTER_PRESS_RECT:States.RESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_IN,\nLEAVE_PRESS_RECT:States.RESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_OUT,\nLONG_PRESS_DETECTED:States.RESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_IN},\n\nRESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_OUT:{\nDELAY:States.ERROR,\nRESPONDER_GRANT:States.ERROR,\nRESPONDER_RELEASE:States.NOT_RESPONDER,\nRESPONDER_TERMINATED:States.NOT_RESPONDER,\nENTER_PRESS_RECT:States.RESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_IN,\nLEAVE_PRESS_RECT:States.RESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_OUT,\nLONG_PRESS_DETECTED:States.ERROR},\n\nerror:{\nDELAY:States.NOT_RESPONDER,\nRESPONDER_GRANT:States.RESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_IN,\nRESPONDER_RELEASE:States.NOT_RESPONDER,\nRESPONDER_TERMINATED:States.NOT_RESPONDER,\nENTER_PRESS_RECT:States.NOT_RESPONDER,\nLEAVE_PRESS_RECT:States.NOT_RESPONDER,\nLONG_PRESS_DETECTED:States.NOT_RESPONDER}};\n\n\n\n// ==== Typical Constants for integrating into UI components ====\n// var HIT_EXPAND_PX = 20;\n// var HIT_VERT_OFFSET_PX = 10;\nvar HIGHLIGHT_DELAY_MS=130;\n\nvar PRESS_EXPAND_PX=20;\n\nvar LONG_PRESS_THRESHOLD=500;\n\nvar LONG_PRESS_DELAY_MS=LONG_PRESS_THRESHOLD-HIGHLIGHT_DELAY_MS;\n\nvar LONG_PRESS_ALLOWED_MOVEMENT=10;\n\n// Default amount \"active\" region protrudes beyond box\n\n/**\n * By convention, methods prefixed with underscores are meant to be @private,\n * and not @protected.

* Animations are an important part of modern UX, and the `Animated`\n * library is designed to make them fluid, powerful, and easy to build and\n * maintain.\n *\n * The simplest workflow is to create an `Animated.Value`, hook it up to one or\n * more style attributes of an animated component, and then drive updates either\n * via animations, such as `Animated.timing`, or by hooking into gestures like\n * panning or scrolling via `Animated.event`.  `Animated.Value` can also bind to\n * props other than style, and can be interpolated as well.  Here is a basic\n * example of a container view that will fade in when it's mounted:\n *\n *```javascript\n *  class FadeInView extends React.Component {\n *    constructor(props) {\n *      super(props);\n *      this.state = {\n *        fadeAnim: new Animated.Value(0), // init opacity 0\n *      };\n *    }\n *    componentDidMount() {\n *      Animated.timing(          // Uses easing functions\n *        this.state.fadeAnim,    // The value to drive\n *        {toValue: 1},           // Configuration\n *      ).start();                // Don't forget start!\n *    }\n *    render() {\n *      return (\n *        <Animated.View          // Special animatable View\n *          style={{opacity: this.state.fadeAnim}}> // Binds\n *          {this.props.children}\n *        </Animated.View>\n *      );\n *    }\n *  }\n *```\n *\n * Note that only animatable components can be animated.  `View`, `Text`, and\n * `Image` are already provided, and you can create custom ones with\n * `createAnimatedComponent`.  These special components do the magic of binding\n * the animated values to the properties, and do targeted native updates to\n * avoid the cost of the react render and reconciliation process on every frame.\n * They also handle cleanup on unmount so they are safe by default.\n *\n * Animations are heavily configurable.  Custom and pre-defined easing\n * functions, delays, durations, decay factors, spring constants, and more can\n * all be tweaked depending on the type of animation.\n *\n * A single `Animated.Value` can drive any number of properties, and each\n * property can be run through an interpolation first.  An interpolation maps\n * input ranges to output ranges, typically using a linear interpolation but\n * also supports easing functions.  By default, it will extrapolate the curve\n * beyond the ranges given, but you can also have it clamp the output value.\n *\n * For example, you may want to think about your `Animated.Value` as going from\n * 0 to 1, but animate the position from 150px to 0px and the opacity from 0 to\n * 1. This can easily be done by modifying `style` in the example above like so:\n *\n *```javascript\n *  style={{\n *    opacity: this.state.fadeAnim, // Binds directly\n *    transform: [{\n *      translateY: this.state.fadeAnim.interpolate({\n *        inputRange: [0, 1],\n *        outputRange: [150, 0]  // 0 : 150, 0.5 : 75, 1 : 0\n *      }),\n *    }],\n *  }}>\n *```\n *\n * Animations can also be combined in complex ways using composition functions\n * such as `sequence` and `parallel`, and can also be chained together simply\n * by setting the `toValue` of one animation to be another `Animated.Value`.\n *\n * `Animated.ValueXY` is handy for 2D animations, like panning, and there are\n * other helpful additions like `setOffset` and `getLayout` to aid with typical\n * interaction patterns, like drag-and-drop.\n *\n * You can see more example usage in `AnimationExample.js`, the Gratuitous\n * Animation App, and [Animations documentation guide](docs/animations.html).\n *\n * Note that `Animated` is designed to be fully serializable so that animations\n * can be run in a high performance way, independent of the normal JavaScript\n * event loop. This does influence the API, so keep that in mind when it seems a\n * little trickier to do something compared to a fully synchronous system.\n * Checkout `Animated.Value.addListener` as a way to work around some of these\n * limitations, but use it sparingly since it might have performance\n * implications in the future.\n */\nmodule.exports={\n/**\n   * Standard value class for driving animations.

For correctness, we must *accumulate\n   * changes* in the centroid of recently moved touches.\n   *\n   * There is also some nuance with how we handle multiple moved touches in a\n   * single event. With the way `ReactNativeEventEmitter` dispatches touches as\n   * individual events, multiple touches generate two 'move' events, each of\n   * them triggering `onResponderMove`.

Therefore, `PanResponder` does not call\n   * `onResponderMove` passed the first dispatch.

The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard.

order:\n *\n * `[R, S, C]`\n *\n * To help illustrate the example, assume `S` is `SimpleEventPlugin` (for\n * `onClick` etc) and `R` is `ResponderEventPlugin`.\n *\n * \"Deferred-Dispatched Events\":\n *\n * - The current event plugin system will traverse the list of injected plugins,\n *   in order, and extract events by collecting the plugin's return value of\n *   `extractEvents()`.\n * - These events that are returned from `extractEvents` are \"deferred\n *   dispatched events\".\n * - When returned from `extractEvents`, deferred-dispatched events contain an\n *   \"accumulation\" of deferred dispatches.\n * - These deferred dispatches are accumulated/collected before they are\n *   returned, but processed at a later time by the `EventPluginHub` (hence the\n *   name deferred).\n *\n * In the process of returning their deferred-dispatched events, event plugins\n * themselves can dispatch events on-demand without returning them from\n * `extractEvents`. Plugins might want to do this, so that they can use event\n * dispatching as a tool that helps them decide which events should be extracted\n * in the first place.\n *\n * \"On-Demand-Dispatched Events\":\n *\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are not returned from `extractEvents`.\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are dispatched during the process of returning\n *   the deferred-dispatched events.\n * - They should not have side effects.\n * - They should be avoided, and/or eventually be replaced with another\n *   abstraction that allows event plugins to perform multiple \"rounds\" of event\n *   extraction.\n *\n * Therefore, the sequence of event dispatches becomes:\n *\n * - `R`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `R` on-demand)\n * - `S`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `S` on-demand)\n * - `C`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `C` on-demand)\n * - `R`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n * - `S`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n * - `C`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n *\n * In the case of `ResponderEventPlugin`: If the `startShouldSetResponder`\n * on-demand dispatch returns `true` (and some other details are satisfied) the\n * `onResponderGrant` deferred dispatched event is returned from\n * `extractEvents`. The sequence of dispatch executions in this case\n * will appear as follows:\n *\n * - `startShouldSetResponder` (`ResponderEventPlugin` dispatches on-demand)\n * - `touchStartCapture`       (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `touchStart`              (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `responderGrant/Reject`   (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n */\n\nfunction setResponderAndExtractTransfer(topLevelType, targetInst, nativeEvent, nativeEventTarget) {\n  var shouldSetEventType = isStartish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.startShouldSetResponder : isMoveish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.moveShouldSetResponder : topLevelType === EventConstants.topLevelTypes.topSelectionChange ? eventTypes.selectionChangeShouldSetResponder : eventTypes.scrollShouldSetResponder;\n\n  // TODO: stop one short of the current responder.\n  var bubbleShouldSetFrom = !responderInst ? targetInst : EventPluginUtils.getLowestCommonAncestor(responderInst, targetInst);\n\n  // When capturing/bubbling the \"shouldSet\" event, we want to skip the target\n  // (deepest ID) if it happens to be the current responder.
